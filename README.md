This document is brought to you by GitHub's Customer Success Architect [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor/) to help developers better use GitHub Copilot and other AI-Powered tools.

Some of these patterns have been tried and proven effective in individual environments, but others are idea-based and have not yet been tested for effectiveness in actual team environments.
Please feel free to leave comments on GitHub Issues. We look forward to various discussions and the sharing of knowledge about AI-Powered development.

## What are Patterns & Exercises

Patterns are a way of describing repeatable solutions to problems within a specific context.
In GitHub Copilot Patterns & Exercises, patterns provide ideas for how developers and teams can use AI to achieve rapid product development.

- **Patterns**: These are tried and true solutions to common problems and scenarios you might encounter when developing with GitHub Copilot. Each pattern is categorized by its level of maturity. ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv0-Pattern_Idea-blueviolet) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv1-Early_Stage_Pattern-blue) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv2-Practically_Viable_Pattern-green) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv3-Mature_Best_Practice-brightgreen)
- **Exercises**: Practical hands-on tasks that can help reinforce your understanding and application of the patterns.

Patterns that are still in development or have not been fully evaluated. Many have been discussed in the community and their usefulness established, but each is at a different level of maturity.
See GitHub Projects for the status of each.
